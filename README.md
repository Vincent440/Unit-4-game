#Instructions
You will be given a random number at the start of the game

There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

You win the game by matching your total score to the random number,
you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.

#Tools utized
*Bootstrap
*jQuery
---------------------------------------------------------------
#things that I could improve on
*could of used less lines of code by having a single click function that pulls the value of the crystals from the html
*by doing this I would of only needed to add something to attach and remove the crystal values on each reset.
*styling because you can never style something enough.
